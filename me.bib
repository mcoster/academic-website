  abstract      = {The trehalose biosynthetic pathway is of great interest for the development of novel therapeutics because trehalose is an essential disaccharide in many pathogens but is neither required nor synthesized in mammalian hosts.  As such, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), a key enzyme in trehalose biosynthesis, is likely an attractive target for novel chemotherapeutics.  Based on a survey of genomes from a panel of parasitic nematodes and bacterial organisms and by way of a structure-based amino acid sequence alignment, we derive the topol. structure of monoenzyme TPPs and classify them into 3 groups.  Comparison of the functional roles of amino acid residues located in the active site for TPPs belonging to different groups reveal nuanced variations.  Because current literature on this enzyme family shows a tendency to infer functional roles for individual amino acid residues, we investigated the roles of the strictly conserved aspartate tetrad in TPPs of the nematode Brugia malayi by using a conservative mutation approach.  In contrast to aspartate-213, the residue inferred to carry out the nucleophilic attack on the substrate, we found that aspartate-215 and aspartate-428 of BmTPP are involved in the chem. steps of enzymic hydrolysis of the substrate.  Therefore, we suggest that homol.-based inference of functionally important amino acids by sequence comparison for monoenzyme TPPs should only be carried out for each of the 3 groups.

  abstract      = {Computational docking as a means to prioritise small mols. in drug discovery projects remains a highly popular in silico screening approach.  Contemporary docking approaches without exptl. parametrisation can reliably differentiate active and inactive chemotypes in a protein binding site, but the absence of a correlation between the score of a predicted binding pose and the biol. activity of the mol. presents a clear limitation.  Several novel or improved computational approaches have been developed in the recent past to aid in screening and profiling of small-mol. ligands for drug discovery, but also more broadly in developing conceptual relationships between different protein targets by chem. probing.  Among those new methodologies is a strategy known as inverse virtual screening, which involves the docking of a compd. into different protein structures.  In the present article, we review the different computational screening methodologies that employ docking of at. models, and, by means of a case study, present an approach that expands the inverse virtual screening concept.  By computationally screening a reasonably sized library of 1235 compds. against a panel of 48 mostly human kinases, we have been able to identify five groups of putative lead compds. with substantial diversity when compared to each other.  One representative of each of the five groups was synthesized, and tested in kinase inhibition assays, yielding two compds. with micro-molar inhibition in five human kinases.  This highly economic and cost-effective methodol. holds great promise for drug discovery projects, esp. in cases where a group of target proteins share high structural similarity in their binding sites.

We tested the antiangiogenic potential of a mitochondrially targeted analog of α-tocopheryl succinate (MitoVES), a compd. with high propensity to induce apoptosis.  Results: MitoVES was found to efficiently kill proliferating endothelial cells (ECs) but not contact-arrested ECs or ECs deficient in mitochondrial DNA, and suppressed angiogenesis in vitro by inducing accumulation of reactive oxygen species and induction of apoptosis in proliferating/angiogenic ECs.  Resistance of arrested ECs was ascribed, at least in part, to the lower mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential compared with the proliferating ECs, thus resulting in the lower level of mitochondrial uptake of MitoVES.  Shorter-chain homologs of MitoVES were less efficient in angiogenesis inhibition, thus suggesting a mol. mechanism of its activity.  Finally, MitoVES was found to suppress HER2-pos. breast carcinomas in a transgenic mouse as well as inhibit tumor angiogenesis.  The antiangiogenic efficacy of MitoVES was corroborated by its inhibitory activity on wound healing in vivo.  Innovation and Conclusion: We conclude that MitoVES, a mitochondrially targeted analog of α-tocopheryl succinate, is an efficient antiangiogenic agent of potential clin. relevance, exerting considerably higher activity than its untargeted counterpart.

We tested here a novel approach, whereby the mitochondrially targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs is enhanced by the addn. of a triphenylphosphonium group (TPP+).  A mitochondrially targeted analog of vitamin E succinate (MitoVES), modified by tagging the parental compd. with TPP+, induced considerably more robust apoptosis in cancer cells with a 1-2 log gain in anti-cancer activity compared to the unmodified counterpart, while maintaining selectivity for malignant cells.  This is because MitoVES assocs. with mitochondria and causes fast generation of reactive oxygen species that then trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, involving transcriptional modulation of the Bcl-2 family proteins.  MitoVES proved superior in suppression of exptl. tumors compared to the untargeted analog.  We propose that mitochondrially targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents offers a new paradigm for increasing the efficacy of compds. with anti-cancer activity. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  abstract      = {Mitochondrial complex II (CII) has been recently identified as a novel target for anti-cancer drugs.  Mitochondrially targeted vitamin E succinate (MitoVES) is modified so that it is preferentially localized to mitochondria, greatly enhancing its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activity.  Using genetically manipulated cells, MitoVES caused apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CII-proficient malignant cells but not their CII-dysfunctional counterparts.  MitoVES inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of CII with IC50 of 80 μM, whereas the electron transfer from CII to CIII was inhibited with IC50 of 1.5 μM.  The agent had no effect either on the enzymic activity of CI or on electron transfer from CI to CIII.  Over 24 h, MitoVES caused stabilization of the oxygen-dependent destruction domain of HIF1α fused to GFP, indicating promotion of the state of pseudohypoxia.  Mol. modeling predicted the succinyl group anchored into the proximal CII ubiquinone (UbQ)-binding site and successively reduced interaction energies for serially shorter phytyl chain homologs of MitoVES correlated with their lower effects on apoptosis induction, ROS generation, and SDH activity.  Mutation of the UbQ-binding Ser68 within the proximal site of the CII SDHC subunit (S68A or S68L) suppressed both ROS generation and apoptosis induction by MitoVES.  In vivo studies indicated that MitoVES also acts by causing pseudohypoxia in the context of tumor suppression.  We propose that mitochondrial targeting of VES with an 11-carbon chain localizes the agent into an ideal position across the interface of the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, optimizing its biol. effects as an anti-cancer drug.

(i) It is a cation selective ion channel that is modulated by extracellular ATP.  Upon stimulation by high concns. of ATP it generates a non-selective membrane pore which is permeable to hydrophilic mols. with mol. wt. up to 900 Da.  (ii) Though its physiol. function is yet to be fully understood, there is high P2X7R expression in microglia.  Importantly, this implies a pivotal role for the P2X7R in neuro-inflammatory and -degenerative processes.  In addn., P2X7R-stimulated release of traditional neurotransmitters in the brain, such as glutamate and GABA, further supports the involvement of P2X7R in neuro-inflammatory and -degenerative processes.  P2X7-knockout animals are also found to be resistant to inflammation and neuropathic pain, which suggests that P2X7 antagonists could potentially serve as all-purpose analgesics.  Recent advances in the development of P2X7R ligands have resulted in identification of several different classes of P2X7R antagonists, including ATP analogs (oxidized ATP), dyes (Brilliant Blue G), tyrosine derivs. (KN-62 and KN-04), cyclic imides, adamantane and benzamide derivs.  A KN-62 related radioligand has also recently been reported for use in receptor binding assays.  A more extensive range of potent, selective P2X7R ligands is required for a better understanding of the cascade of cellular processes assocd. with the P2X7R.

Following a dose of 50 mg/kg TC1, a max. of 31% substitution was reached.  The response rate was reduced to 56% of vehicle control following a TC1 dose of 100 mg/kg.  These behavioral effects suggest that TC1 can act as an antagonist via the σ1 receptor.  In contrast to TC1, TC4 produced a stimulant effect in locomotor activity with the ED50 estd. at 0.94 mg/kg.  In addn., TC4 failed to inhibit cocaine-induced stimulation; neither did it substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine.  TC4 thus appears to interact predominantly with the σ2 receptor subtype (σ1/σ2 = 7.6) which may result in dopamine stimulation independent of the effects of cocaine.  The differential effect of TC1 and TC4 warrants further study of the mechanism of these actions.  Present data also suggests a potential role for trishomocubane analogs in developing medication or research tools for cocaine addiction. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Coupling of the AB- and CD-spiroacetal subunits, I and II, resp., by a stereoselective aldol reaction was achieved by using either a lithium (67:33 dr) or boron enolate (90:10 dr).  A highly (Z)-selective Wittig coupling was used to unite the northern hemisphere aldehyde III with the southern hemisphere phosphonium salt IV.  Deprotection and subsequent regioselective macrolactonization on a triol seco-acid completed the synthesis of altohyrtin A.

Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) is a pivotal enzyme in the most prominent biosynthesis pathway (OtsAB).  Here, we compare the enzyme characteristics of recombinant TPPs from five important nematode and bacterial pathogens, including three novel members of this protein family.  Analysis of the kinetics of trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolysis reveals that all five enzymes display a burst-like kinetic behaviour which is characterised by a decrease of the enzymatic rate after the pre-steady state.  The observed super-stoichiometric burst amplitudes can be explained by multiple global conformational changes in members of this enzyme family during substrate processing.  In the search for specific TPP inhibitors, the trapping of the complex conformational transitions in TPPs during the catalytic cycle may present a worthwhile strategy to explore.[on SciFinder (R)]},
