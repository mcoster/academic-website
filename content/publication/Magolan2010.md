abstract = "A review.  The emerging anti-austerity anti-cancer therapeutic strategy targets the ability of certain cancer cell lines, particularly pancreatic cancer, to survive nutrient deprivation.  While biochem. pathways for the tolerance to nutrient deprivation are still not well understood, a growing no. of inhibitors of this process are being discovered.  A no. of natural products have been isolated, structurally characterized and evaluated as inhibitors of austerity, thereby providing valuable initial structure-activity relationship data."
