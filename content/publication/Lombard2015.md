abstract = "A review.  The selective functionalization of C-H bonds is a powerful strategy for the construction of org. mols. and the Rh(II)-catalyzed C-H insertion reaction is a particularly robust and useful tool for this purpose.  This review discusses the insertion of Rh(II) carbenes into C-H bonds that are activated by α-oxygen substituents, focusing on the trends that have been obsd. in reactivity and selectivity, and the applications of this reaction to the total synthesis of complex natural products."
