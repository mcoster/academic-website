The key step is a thermally-induced, highly regioselective and diastereoselective Diels-Alder reaction between (_E_)-_N_-methoxy-_N_-(methyl)cinnamide and ocimene under solvent-free conditions.  The synthesis of the target compd. was achieved using (1_R_,5_S_,6_R_)-rel-4-methyl-5-(3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl)-6-phenyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde and 2-bromo-5-methoxy-1,3-_bis_[[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methoxy]benzene as reactants."
