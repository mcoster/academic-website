abstract = "The plant natural product, valerenic acid (**1**) was chosen as a desirable scaffold for the generation of a novel screening library due to its drug-like physicochemical parameters (such as LogP, hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts, and molecular weight). An 11-membered amide library (**2**–**12**) was subsequently generated using parallel solution-phase synthesis and Ghosez’s reagent. The chemical structures of all semi-synthetic analogues (**2**–**12**) were elucidated following analysis of the NMR, MS, UV and IR data. The structures of compounds **8** and **11** were also confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. All library members were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-8 and TNF-&alpha;. Six analogues showed moderate activity in the IL-8 assay with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.8–8.3 &mu;M, while none of the tested compounds showed any significant effect on inhibiting TNF-&alpha; release."
