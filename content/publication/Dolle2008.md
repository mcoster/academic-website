abstract = "Within the class of (4-pyridinyl)vinylpyridines developed by Abbott labs. as potent neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands, p-PVP-MEMA ({(_R_)-2-[6-chloro-5-((_E_)-2-pyridin-4-ylvinyl)pyridin-3-yloxy]-1-methylethyl}methylamine) is the lead compd. of a novel series that do not display the traditional nicotinic-like pyrrole-ring but still possessing high subnanomolar affinity (Ki 0.077 nm-displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H](-)cytisine from whole rat brain synaptic membranes).  In the present study, p-PVP-MEMA and its nor-deriv. ({(_R_)-2-[6-chloro-5-((_E_)-2-pyridin-4-ylvinyl)pyridin-3-yloxy]-1-methylethyl}methylamine) as precursor for labeling with the short-lived positron-emitter carbon-11 (T<sub>1/2</sub> 20.4 min) were synthesized in 10 chem. steps from 2-hydroxy-5-nitropyridine and Boc-D-alanine.  _N_-Alkylation of nor-p-PVP-MEMA with [<sup>11</sup>C]methyl iodide afforded [<sup>11</sup>C]p-PVP-MEMA (>98% radiochem. pure, specific activity of 86.4 GBq μmol<sup>-1</sup>) in 2% (non-decay cor. and non-optimized) radiochem. yield, in 34 min (including HPLC purifn. and formulation).  Preliminary positron emission tomog. (PET) results obtained in a Papio hamadryas baboon showed that [<sup>11</sup>C]p-PVP-MEMA is not a suitable PET-radioligand."
