abstract = "The soluble mycobacterial carbonic anhydrases Rv3588c and Rv1284 belong to a different class of carbonic anhydrases than those found in humans, making them attractive drug targets by using the inherent differences in the folds of the different classes. By screening a natural product library, we identified naphthoquinone derivatives as a novel non-classical inhibitor scaffold of mycobacterial carbonic anhydrases that lack the sulfonamide/sulfamate group and thus did not affect human carbonic anhydrase II."
