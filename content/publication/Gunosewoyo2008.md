abstract = "CH2NHCOR1 [R = 1-adamantanyl, 1-cubyl; R1 = 2-FC6H4, 4-FC6H4, 2,5-Cl(MeO)C6H3] were synthesized and their lipophilicity profiles were evaluated using reverse-phase HPLC.  All synthesized compds. possessed P2X7R antagonistic properties when tested on rat spinal cord microglia cells.  Extensive screening for binding to other neuroceptor subtypes demonstrated their P2X7 selectivity."
