abstract = "The cytotoxic natural product (+)-goniodiol was prepd. in twelve steps from enantiomerically pure cis-dihydrocatechol, which is readily obtained by microbial oxidn. of naphthalene.  Elaboration of the cis-dihydrocatechol involves an initial oxidative cleavage to dialdehyde followed by redn. to give a diol.  Conversion of the diol into an acetal required, inter alia, selective oxidn. of the benzylic alc. moiety followed by a metal-catalyzed decarbonylation of the resulting aldehyde.  Allylation of I with allyltributylstannane in the presence of lithium perchlorate gave a ca. 2.7:1 mixt. of alcs., each of which was converted into the corresponding acrylate under std. conditions.  Subjection of these ester derivs. to a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction with Grubbs' first-generation catalyst gave the anticipated lactone II and its diastereomer.  Acid-catalyzed removal of the acetonide protecting group within II then afforded (+)-goniodiol, while analogous deprotection of the congener afforded 6-_epi_-(+)-goniodiol."
