abstract = "A new general method for the construction of medium ring ethers has been developed.  This involves the ring expansion of halo-O,S-acetals followed by a Ramberg-Backlund ring contraction reaction with concomitant extrusion of the sulfur atom.  This methodol. has been utilized for the synthesis of racemic cis- and trans-lauthisan (I and II resp.)."
