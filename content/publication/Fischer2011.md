abstract = "A sequence of Sonogashira coupling, Pd(II)-catalyzed carbonylative annulation, and benzofuran redn. (Mg, MeOH, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) provides a convergent and modular synthetic route to _trans_-2-aryl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[_b_]furan-3-carboxylates, which share structural features with numerous biol. active natural products. This versatile strategy was applied to the formal total synthesis of the anti-HIV natural product (+)-lithospermic acid (I)."
