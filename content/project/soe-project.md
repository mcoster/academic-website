The late-stage derivatisation of bioactive molecules using highly selective synthetic organic chemistry reactions is a convenient and attractive method for the preparation of analogues for determination of structure-activity relationships and with the potential for tuning of physicochemical and ADMET properties. Recent developments in synthetic methodology have greatly expanded the arsenal of highly selective transformations available to the synthetic chemist.[^1] A particularly recent advance is the development of direct electrochemical reactions on organic molecules[^2] using convenient ‘all-in-one’ _synthetic organic electrochemistry_ (**SOE**) apparatus.[^3]

This project will investigate the derivatisation of a selection of bioactive natural and non-natural organic compounds using electrochemical techniques, and the development of new synthetic organic electrochemistry transformations of potential use in drug discovery.
