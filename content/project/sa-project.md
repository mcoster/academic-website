Glioblastoma is the most common malignant adult primary brain cancer. Median survival is <15 months and only about 10% of patients survive two years without disease recurrence.[^1] This dismal situation motivates a search for new therapeutic approaches and in particular therapies which target the chemo/radiation-resistant tumour propagating cells, often referred to as glioma stem cells (GSCs).[^2] This project seeks to synthesise analogues of an exciting natural product that has anti-cancer activity against GSCs and other cancer stem cells (CSCs).[^3] The compounds will be evaluated as potential drug candidates and certain derivatives could allow mechanism of action and target identification studies.
